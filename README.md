# Mirror-Game-2
An FPS 3d puzzle game.
You can find the first game [here](https://github.com/muhammet484/Mirror-Game).
first game was bad and was one of my beginner projects so it has so much spaghetti codes. 
In this project I more pay attention to use design patterns, clean code writing, agile principles and more about good coding...

I am currently work on this project since 26 january 2023
You can examine and develop this game with me also. any "github request" will be appreciated :)
You should install 2022.2.3f1 version of unity to open project
